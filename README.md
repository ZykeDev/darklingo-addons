# Darklingo++ Addon & Custom Fixes

> **NOTE**: This repo has been discontinued as I have A) stopped using Duolingo, and B) moved to [Dark Reader](https://darkreader.org/) to browse in dark mode (doesn't offer as much granularity, but it's less of a hassle).

A userstyle with custom, temporary fixes to address updated features that the base Darklingo++ version has yet to implement, as well as some improvements for Duolingo-related addons (Slate style only).

This addon also adds an option to Show or Hide all ad/ad-blocked boxes.
