## Contributing

Please ensure your pull request adheres to the following guidelines:

* Search open and closed PR's to avoid duplicate suggestions.
* The PR should have a useful title. If more details are needed, write them down in the PR description.
* Feel free to suggest color/style changes, but remember this repo is mostly for personal use and therefore follows my ([@ZykeDev](https://github.com/ZykeDev)) personal preferences.
* Try to use the :root variables as much as possible. If you believe a new var is needed/useful, add it at the end of the :root definition.
* Use shorthand where possible. e.g. `margin: 10px 10px 5px;`
* Use the `!important` property only when needed.
